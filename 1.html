 George Frideric (or Frederick) Handel (/ˈhændəl/;[a] born Georg Friedrich Händel[b] German: [ˈhɛndəl] (About this soundlisten); 23 February 1685 (O.S.) [(N.S.) 5 March] – 14 April 1759)[2][c] was a German, later British, Baroque composer who spent the bulk of his career in London, becoming well-known for his operas, oratorios, anthems, and organ concertos. Handel received important training in Halle-upon-Saale and worked as a composer in Hamburg and Italy before settling in London in 1712; he became a naturalised British subject in 1727.[5] He was strongly influenced both by the great composers of the Italian Baroque and by the middle-German polyphonic choral tradition.
